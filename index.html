                    <h5>Hurricanes</h5>
                    <h3>Hurricanes are a type of storm called a tropical cyclone, which forms over tropical or subtropical waters. They originate in the Atlantic basin, which includes the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico, the eastern North Pacific Ocean, and, less frequently, the central North Pacific Ocean. A six-year rotating list of names, updated and maintained by the World Meteorological Organization, is used to identify these storms."Hurricane Season" begins on June 1 and ends on November 30, although hurricanes can, and have, occurred outside of this time frame.

                              <p>The birth of a hurricane requires at least three conditions:
                                <br><br>1. The ocean waters must be warm enough at the surface to put enough heat and moisture into the overlying atmosphere to provide the potential fuel for the thermodynamic engine that a hurricane becomes.
                                <br><br>2. Atmospheric moisture from sea water evaporation must combine with that heat and energy to form the powerful engine needed to propel a hurricane.
                                <br><br>3. A wind pattern must be near the ocean surface to spirals air inward. Bands of thunderstorms form, allowing the air to warm further and rise higher into the atmosphere.
                                <br><br>If the winds at these higher levels are relatively light, this structure can remain intact and grow stronger, causing the beginnings of a hurricane

                                <p>In the United States, hurricanes primarily form off Central Mexico. 95% of the time they move westward, away form land. Sometimes a hurricane hits Western Mexico or Baja California, but quickly loose their strength over the deserts with its remains bringing rains to the deserts of Arizona and California. Occasionally, a hurricane that formed off Mexico reaches Hawaii. Once in a while, an East Pacific hurricane travels far enough west to cross into the Eastern Hemisphere and then it is called a typhoon. <br><br>The fuel for the tropical cyclones is warm water, that's why hurricanes weaken rapidly once over land. The sea temperatures off California are not usually warm enough for tropical cyclone formation.</p>

                              <p>Until the early 1950s, tropical storms and hurricanes were tracked by year and the order in which they occurred during that year. Over time, it was learned that the use of short, easily remembered names in written as well as spoken communications is quicker and reduces confusion when two or more tropical storms occur at the same time. In the past, confusion and false rumors resulted when storm advisories broadcast from radio stations were mistaken for warnings concerning an entirely different storm located hundreds of miles away.

                              <br><br>There are strict procedures established by the World Meteorological Organization for naming hurricanes. For Atlantic hurricanes, there is a list of male and female names which are used on a six-year rotation. The only time that there is a change is if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate. In the event that more than twenty-one named tropical cyclones occur in a season, any additional storms will take names from the Greek alphabet.

                      <br>Very dangerous winds will produce some damage:
                        <br> Well-constructed frame homes could have damage to roof, shingles, vinyl siding and gutters. Large branches of trees will snap and shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days.
